                Map: This function is used to create a new array by applying a transformation function to each element of an existing array. The map function returns a new array of the same length as the original array, with each element transformed based on the function provided. The original array remains unchanged. <br>

                ForEach: This function is used to loop through an array and perform a specified action for each element. It does not return anything and does not modify the original array. <br>

This data can only be accessed by the domain that created it.

<div>
    <h1 class="text-2xl my-3">
        <span class="bg-green-600 px-2 rounded text-white text-3xl" >Q3</span> What is Event Loop and it's Working Proccess
    </h1>
    <p>
        The event loop is a key concept in JavaScript that is responsible for handling asynchronous events and maintaining the concurrency model of JavaScript. It is a continuous loop that runs in the background of a JavaScript runtime environment, such as a web browser or Node.js, and continuously checks the event queue for new events to process. <br>

When an asynchronous event occurs, such as a user click, a network request, or a timer expiring, it is added to the event queue. The event loop continuously checks the event queue and when an event is found, it is removed from the queue and processed by the event loop. <br>

The event loop works by following these basic steps:
<li  class="my-4">Execute any synchronous tasks in the call stack until it is empty. </li>
<li  class="my-4"> Check the event queue for any pending events.</li>
<li  class="my-4"> If an event is found in the event queue, remove it from the queue and execute its associated callback function (i.e., the function that was registered to handle that event).</li>
<li  class="my-4">If the event queue is empty, wait for new events to arrive. </li>
This process allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous events in a non-blocking and efficient manner, while also ensuring that the synchronous code executes first before processing any pending events.

<!-- question 4  -->
<h1 class="text-2xl my-3">
    <span class="bg-green-600 px-2 rounded text-white text-3xl" >Q4</span> What is the purpose of quizTimer Function ?
</h1>
<p class=" my-3">
    The quizTimer function  that creates a timer to display the elapsed time on an HTML element with an id of count. The function takes one parameter dismiss, which if truthy, stops the timer.
</p>
<!-- question 5  -->
<h1 class="text-2xl my-3">
    <span class="bg-green-600 px-2 rounded text-white text-3xl" >Q5</span> What is the purpose of chooseQuiz Function ?
</h1>
<p class=" my-3">
    This  chooseQuiz function that takes two parameters: index and givenAns. The purpose of the function is to select or choose a quiz by its index and store the given answer in the answers array. The function first checks if an answer for the selected quiz already exists in the answers array using the Array.find() method. If an answer exists, it updates the givenAns property of the corresponding quiz object using the Array.splice() method. <br>

If the answer does not exist, the function creates a new quiz object with the givenAns property and pushes it to the answers array using the Array.push() method.
The function then calls another function named displayAnswers and passes the answers array as an argument to update the display of the answer summary.
